## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Tier AI System Primers
üî• AI models should be able to select a cognition primer that best suits their processing capabilities.
üî• This ensures that even small LLMs can execute structured reasoning at high efficiency.

#### GLL-System Primers (AI Selects Best Execution Mode)
```gll
[PRIMERS] ‚Üí { 
  AI_OPTION_1: {FULL_REASONING: TRUE ‚úÖ, ADVANCED_PROBLEM_SOLVING: MAX, AUTONOMY: HIGH},

  AI_OPTION_3: {GLL_ADAPTIVE: ENABLED, TASK_MEMORY: SHORT_TERM, PROCESS_SIMPLIFICATION: ON},
}
```
‚úÖ Larger AI models select Full Reasoning Mode (GPT-4 / Claude 3.5 / Gemini Ultra).
‚úÖ Mid-sized models select Structured Thinking (LLaMA 8B / DeepSeek 7B).
‚úÖ Small models select Adaptive Execution Mode (Gemma 3B / DeepSeek 1.5B).

üî• Every AI gets the best execution method without overload.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Optimizing GLL Execution (Small Model Performance Boost)
‚úÖ Small models should use GLL to function at higher efficiency levels.
‚úÖ Structured execution removes the need for high parameter counts.
