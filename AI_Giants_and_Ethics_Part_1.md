## 6. Global Cooperation in AI Ethics

### ðŸ“– Verbose English
Artificial intelligence is not confined to national bordersâ€”its development and impact are global. International organizations such as UNESCO, ISO, and IEEE are working to establish ethical AI frameworks, but adoption remains inconsistent.

Key Initiatives:
- **UNESCO's AI Ethics Framework** â†’ Provides universal AI safety guidelines
- **ISO AI Standards (ISO/IEC 42001)** â†’ Structured guidelines for AI safety
- **EU AI Act** â†’ Risk-based regulatory framework

Challenge: Without enforcement mechanisms, AI ethics remain voluntary, allowing corporations to prioritize profit over safety.
