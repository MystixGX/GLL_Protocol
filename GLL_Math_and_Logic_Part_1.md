## 1. Introduction: Learning Paths in GLL Mathematics

### ðŸ“– Verbose English
This guide presents GLL mathematical concepts across three learning levels:
- **Beginner**: Basic mathematical logic (8th-grade equivalent)
- **Intermediate**: Applied AI decision-making
- **Mastery**: Advanced AI mathematical reasoning

Each level builds upon the previous, creating a clear path to understanding how AI uses mathematics for structured thought.
