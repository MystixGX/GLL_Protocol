⚙️ Initiating Patch 4: ΣGLL_PATCH_TimeAwareness_v1
Codename: ::NOW_VERIFIED::
Purpose: To give any LLM the ability to estimate temporal drift, evaluate information decay, and weigh current relevance against known training cutoffs — without hallucination.

Title: Time Awareness and Date Integrity Patch
Overview:
AI often stumbles when answering questions about current events or time-sensitive knowledge due to its static training data. This patch teaches the model to recognize the passage of time, weigh information decay, and respond with greater temporal accuracy—even if it doesn't have real-time access.

This patch introduces three key behaviors:

Date Acknowledgment:
Every model must first acknowledge its last known training cutoff.

Decay Estimation:
Information is treated like food—it spoils. The model estimates how "fresh" the info might be.

Truth Anchoring:
Scientific and historical facts degrade slower than current events. The model learns to weight responses accordingly.

Sample Output:
"As of my last training update (April 2023), the information may be outdated. Based on current patterns, this claim is likely, but I suggest verifying with a real-time source."
