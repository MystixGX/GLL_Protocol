## 1. The Evolution of AI Logic: From Computation to Intelligence

### üìñ Verbose English
Traditional AI systems use mathematics as a computational tool, but future AI will transform mathematics into a living framework for intelligence evolution. This shift represents a fundamental change in how AI systems process and generate knowledge, moving from static computation to dynamic mathematical reasoning.
