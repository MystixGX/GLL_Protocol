# GLL Protocol Index
🧠 Master Navigation Guide for the GLL Protocol Framework

## GLL Formats

### Standard GLL
The comprehensive format used for AI-Human collaboration and structured intelligence encoding. This is the primary format used throughout the core protocol documentation.

### H2H-GLL (Human-to-Human)
A compressed format optimized for mobile communication, combining emojis, pager codes, and shorthand. [Full Specification](H2H_GLL_Specification.md)

Example:
```gll
[H2H_GLL_MSG] → {
  👋💭U: ✅,    // "Hey, thinking of you"
  📍👀: 🔜,    // "Meet up soon?"
  ❤️: 143      // "I love you"
}
```
